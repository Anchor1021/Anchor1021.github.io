**Welcome!** I am Boqi Zhao, a PhD student in _Computer Science_ at the University of California, Davis. I received my Master of Science in Computer Science from UC Davis in 2025, and later transferred to the CS PhD program in [DARE](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang/research-group/) lab, advised by [Dr. Junshan Zhang](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang/).  
My research focuses on `robotics learning`, particularly in `reinforcement learning`, `imitation learning`, `world models`. I am dedicated to developing robotics systems with advanced generalization capabilities for complex, real-world tasks.
I am always open to discussions and collaborations, feel free to contact me.
