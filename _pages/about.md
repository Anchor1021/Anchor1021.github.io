**Welcome!** I am *Dechen Gao*, a PhD candidate in *Computer Science* at the University of California, Davis. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Iman Soltani](https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu/people/iman-soltani) and [Dr. Junshan Zhang](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang/), and to work with my labmates at [LARA](https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu/) and [DARE](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang/research-group/).  

I interned at *Meta* (2022) and *TikTok* (2024) and will be joining *Amazon* as an Applied Scientist Intern in 2025.

My research focuses on ``robotic learning``, particularly in ``reinforcement learning``, ``imitation learning``, ``world models``, and ``foundation models``.
