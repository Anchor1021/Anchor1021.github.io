**Welcome!** I am _Dechen Gao_, a PhD candidate in _Computer Science_ at the University of California, Davis. I received my _Master of Science in Computer Science_ from UC Davis in 2023, and later transferred to the CS PhD program with the support of my advisors [Dr. Iman Soltani](https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu/people/iman-soltani) and [Dr. Junshan Zhang](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang/). I am grateful to work with my advisors, and collaborate with all my labmates at [LARA](https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu/) and [DARE](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang/research-group/).

My research focuses on `robotic learning`, particularly in `reinforcement learning`, `imitation learning`, `world models`, and `foundation models`. I am always open to discussions adn collaborations on these topics - feel free to drop me an email if you are interested!

I interned at _Meta_ (2022) and _TikTok_ (2024) and will be joining _Amazon_ as an Applied Scientist Intern in 2025.
